  patch_update: '🎓 Patching does not protect against social engineering — phishing targets the human, not the software.',
  lockdown: '🎓 MONEY LOCK helps after you recognize a scam — but it cannot prevent you from unlocking it voluntarily under deception.',
  two_factor_auth: '🎓 OTPs fail against phishing — scammers capture your OTP in real-time via fake banking portals.',
